Then each object whose accessibility level is the same as that of the

exists. These actions are performed whether the master is left by reaching 
the last statement or via a transfer of control. When a transfer of control 
causes completion of an execution, each included master is finalized 
in order, from innermost outward.&nbsp;</div>
