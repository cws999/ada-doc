<H1>Chapter 1: Introduction</H1>
<div class="Normal">The first version of Ada (Ada 83) was developed by 
a team led by the late Jean Ichbiah and funded by the USDoD. The development 
of Ada 95 was done under the leadership of Tucker Taft and also funded 
by the USDoD. Then came Ada 2005 and Ada 2012 <A HREF="RCorr-0-1.html#R1">[1,</A> 
<A HREF="RCorr-0-1.html#R2">2]</A> which were developed on a more modest 
scale and largely done by voluntary effort with support from within the 
industry itself by bodies such as the Ada Resource Association and Ada-Europe.<A NAME="I1001"></A><A NAME="I1002"></A></div>
<div class="Normal">The Ada Rapporteur Group (ARG) is a team of experts 
nominated by the national bodies represented on WG9 (ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC22/WG9, 
the working group for Ada) and the two liaison organizations, ACM SIGAda 
and Ada-Europe. In the case of Ada 2005, the ARG was originally led by 
Erhard Pl&ouml;dereder and then by Pascal Leroy. For Ada 2012, it was 
led by Ed Schonberg. Since the Ada 2012 standard was issued the ARG has 
been led by Jeff Cousins. The editor, who at the end of the day actually 
writes the words of the standard, continues to be the indefatigable Randy 
Brukardt and the convenor of WG9 is Joyce Tokar. <A NAME="I1003"></A><A NAME="I1004"></A><A NAME="I1005"></A><A NAME="I1006"></A><A NAME="I1007"></A></div>
<div class="Normal">The changes made to Ada 2012 by the update are presented 
in the same areas as in the Ada 2012 Rationale <A HREF="RCorr-0-1.html#R3">[3]</A> 
to ease any comparison. In each area the relevant Ada Issues (AIs) are 
listed and this is then followed by a brief discussion. It will be observed 
that many issues concern corner cases which will not be of much interest 
to the average user. Moreover, the changes are usually corrections to 
the descriptive text. But just occasionally we get the excitement of 
a new aspect, a new type or subprogram and even a new bit of syntax!</div>
<div class="Normal">Note that some Ada Issues were mentioned in the Postscript 
section of the Ada 2012 Rationale published after the standard was approved 
(and in Programming in Ada 2012 <A HREF="RCorr-0-1.html#R4">[4]</A> by 
the author). They are given here for completeness and are marked with 
*. But note that they might have changed again since the Rationale was 
written.</div>
<div class="Normal">The updated version of Ada 2012 was approved by WG 
9 in June 2015, by SC 22 in December 2015, and published by ISO in February 
2016. It is formally ISO/IEC 8652:2012/Cor 1:2016, entitled Technical 
Corrigendum 1 for Ada 2012, or TC1 for short <A HREF="RCorr-0-1.html#R5">[5]</A>.
