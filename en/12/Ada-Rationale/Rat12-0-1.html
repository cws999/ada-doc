<H1>Foreword</H1>
<div class="Normal">Programming languages and their user and implementer 
communities are living organisms, which &mdash; as time goes by &mdash; 
either decay and perish in obsolescence or evolve in a dynamic combination 
of wisdom that comes with age and freshness that comes with vision.</div>
<div class="Normal">Almost six years after writing the foreword to the 
Rationale for Ada 2005, I look with marvel at Ada 2012, at how it has 
come about, at the extent of innovation that it carries, and at the competence, 
dedication, rigour, perseverance and solidity of the community that has 
worked to make it happen.</div>
<div class="Normal">Ada 2005 was in many ways a beautiful programming 
language, perhaps more intellectually than aesthetically, as in the Ada 
style of things. It brought the promises of Ada 95 to maturation and 
added great features in a number of its key areas of strength. The technology 
gap was important for some vendors however, and the user community had 
to invest considerable resources in digesting the novelty that it brought 
about. Ada 2005 attracted attention to itself from outside its niche 
market and gained respect from those knowledgeable in object orientation, 
real-time and systems programming and container libraries. So one may 
wonder what caused the Ada 2012 project to start at all, aside from the 
normative obligation entailed by ISO governance, to confirm, withdraw 
or amend every individual standard at five year intervals.</div>
<div class="Normal">The term that comes to mind to explain the Ada 2012 
project is &quot;vision&quot;. Ada has always been strong in application 
domains where safety and criticality concerns are paramount. For as much 
as those domains are intrinsically conservative and not inclined to giant 
leaps, their needs, however, are not static and, as of late, have begun 
to evolve more rapidly than in the past, to keep pace with internal and 
external changes. New needs emerged, which required fresh attention and 
timely response. It takes vision to see those needs coming and even more 
so to devise a response to them that meets the user requirement, can 
be satisfactorily developed by language implementers, and fits in with 
the language structure, style and use.</div>
<div class="Normal">One major emerging need was for specification contracts 
to protect the program from incorrect composition at run time. For programs 
to be robust, safely reusable and long lasting, you want expressive contracts 
to be attached to specifications &mdash; contracts that talk to the programmer 
and not only to the compiler &mdash; so that a solid and semantically 
rich understanding can be established between the user of the program 
component, be it a procedure or a type, and its implementer. The Ada 
2012 response to this challenge was to introduce pre- and post-conditions 
for subprograms, invariants for types and predicates for subtypes. This 
was a bold move that made Ada the first mainstream programming language 
to offer those features as part of an ISO standard.</div>
<div class="Normal">The other main need was to allow Ada programs to 
run, with adequate guarantees of time predictability, on multicore and 
multithreaded architectures. The Ada response to this need has been solid 
so that users can build on it safely and effectively but also cautious: 
multicore architectures and parallel programming are very complex beasts, 
which defeat intuition, break composability and threaten predictability. 
Much more research is needed to learn how to master all aspects of them 
before relevant solutions become mature enough to make it into industrial 
technology such as Ada.</div>
<div class="Normal">While working on those two momentous challenges, 
as directed by WG9, the body within ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22 which has responsibility 
for the maintenance of the Ada standard, the ARG (the body of technical 
experts that actually does the language standard maintenance work) of 
course also considered corrective and adaptive maintenance needs arising 
from user and implementation experience with Ada 2005. In the end, the 
amount of work that went into the Ada 2012 project and the extent of 
changes that resulted from it were larger than anticipated: evidence 
that there is energy that can be drawn from in the Ada community.</div>
<div class="Normal">It is a pleasure for me to invite the reader to read 
and enjoy this Rationale for Ada 2012, under the knowledgeable hand, 
deft guidance, and witty style of its author, John Barnes, who continues 
to surprise me with how vast, profound, and complete is his understanding 
of the language, no matter how large it grows. It is especially instructive 
for me to appreciate how humbling it is to parallel my standing to his, 
in all matters of Ada authority.</div>
<div class="Normal">Producing this book as an LNCS volume is a financial 
burden that Ada-Europe would not have been able to sustain alone. On 
behalf of Ada-Europe, I am grateful to all those who supported the production 
project. Particularly prominent, in fact, and indeed vital, in that respect 
has been the role of AdaCore, which I want to acknowledge both personally 
and institutionally.</div>
<div class="Normal">Much as happened with the Rationale for Ada 2005, 
the readers of the Ada User Journal, the quarterly publication of Ada-Europe, 
were able to get first-hand incremental instalments of the Rationale 
for Ada 2012. Having stepped from the role of editor-in-chief of the 
Ada User Journal to that of President of Ada-Europe I have perhaps gained 
in status but lost the privilege of being the first reader of those instalments. 
An LNCS volume entirely devoted to the Rationale for Ada 2012 is a great 
achievement, as a prestigious venue in itself, and as the continuation 
of the Ada presence in a lead vehicle for the publication of advances 
in computer science.</div>
<div class="Normal">It is most likely that writing this Foreword closes 
the bracket that inaugurated my service as President of Ada-Europe by 
writing the Foreword to the 2005 edition of the Rationale. I am taking 
this as a wish that Ada 2012 will have a sufficiently long and successful 
life to see me safely go before a new Foreword will have to be written.</div>
<div class="Normal">Dear reader: I am delighted that I can again present 
to your doorstep, or to a library near you, a book of this value; I promise 
you that it will be worth your reading.</div>
