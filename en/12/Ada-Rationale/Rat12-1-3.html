<H1>1.3 Overview of changes</H1>
<div class="Normal" style="margin-bottom: 0.4em">It would be tedious 
to give a section by section review of the changes as seen by the Reference 
Manual language lawyer. Instead, the changes will be presented by areas 
as seen by the user. There can be considered to be six areas:</div>
<div class="Enumerated-Term">a)</div><div class="Enumerated-Body">
Introduction of dynamic contracts. These can be seen to lead on from 
the introduction of the <SPAN Class="swiss">Assert</SPAN> pragma in Ada 
2005. New syntax (using <B>with</B> again) introduces aspect specifications 
which enable certain properties of entities to be stated where they are 
declared rather than later using representation clauses. This is put 
to good use in introducing pre- and postconditions for subprograms and 
similar assertions for types and subtypes.</div>
<div class="Enumerated-Term">b)</div><div class="Enumerated-Body">
More flexible expressions. The introduction of preconditions and so on 
increases the need for more powerful forms of expressions. Accordingly, 
if expressions, case expressions, quantified expressions and expression 
functions are all added. A related change is that membership tests are 
generalized.</div>
<div class="Enumerated-Term">c)</div><div class="Enumerated-Body">
Structure and visibility control. Functions are now permitted to have 
<B>out</B> and <B>in out</B> parameters, and rules are introduced to 
minimize the risk of inadvertent dependence on order of evaluation of 
parameters and other entities such as aggregates. More flexibility is 
permitted with incomplete types and another form of use clause is introduced. 
There are minor enhancements to extended return statements.</div>
<div class="Enumerated-Term">d)</div><div class="Enumerated-Body">
Tasking and real-time improvements. Almost all of the changes are in 
the Real-Time Systems annex. New packages are added for the control of 
tasks and budgeting on multiprocessor systems, and the monitoring of 
time spent in interrupts. There are also additional facilities for non-preemptive 
dispatching, task barriers and suspension objects.</div>
<div class="Enumerated-Term">e)</div><div class="Enumerated-Body">
Improvements to other general areas. More flexibility is allowed in the 
position of labels, pragmas, and null statements. A number of corrections 
are made to the accessibility rules, improvements are made to conversions 
of access types, and further control over storage pools is added. The 
composability of equality is now the same for both tagged and untagged 
record types.</div>
<div class="Enumerated-Term">f)</div><div class="Enumerated-Body">
Extensions to the standard library. Variants on the existing container 
packages are introduced to handle bounded containers more efficiently. 
Additional containers are added for a simple holder, multiway trees and 
queues. Moreover, a number of general features have been added to make 
containers and other such reusable libraries easier to use. Minor additions 
cover directories, locale capabilities, string encoding and further operations 
on wide and wide wide characters.&nbsp;</div>
<div class="Normal">The reader might feel that the changes are quite 
extensive but each has an important role to play in making Ada more useful. 
Indeed the solution of one problem often leads to auxiliary requirements. 
The desire to introduce stronger description of contracts led to the 
search for good syntax which led to aspect specifications. And these 
strengthened the need for more flexible forms of expressions and so on. 
Some changes were driven by outside considerations such as multiprocessors 
and others stem from what now seem to be obvious but minor flaws in Ada 
2005.</div>
<div class="Normal">A number of potential changes were rejected as really 
unnecessary. For example, the author was at one time enthused by a desire 
for fixed point cyclic types. But it proved foolish without base 60 hardware 
to match our inheritance of arithmetic in a Babylonian style for angles.</div>
<div class="Normal">Before looking at the six areas in a little more 
detail it is perhaps worth saying a few words about compatibility with 
Ada 2005. The guidelines gave the ARG freedom to be sensible in this 
area. Of course, the worst incompatibilities are those where a valid 
program in Ada 2005 continues to be valid in Ada 2012 but does something 
different. It is believed that incompatibilities of this nature will 
be most unlikely to arise in practice.</div>
<div class="Normal">However, incompatibilities whereby a valid Ada 2005 
program fails to compile in Ada 2012 are tolerable provided they are 
infrequent. A few such incompatibilities are possible. The most obvious 
cause is the introduction of one more reserved word, namely <B>some</B>, 
which is used in quantified expressions to match <B>all</B>. Thus if 
an existing Ada 2005 program uses <B>some</B> as an identifier then it 
will need modification. Once again, the introduction of a new category 
of unreserved keywords was considered but was eventually rejected as 
confusing.</div>
