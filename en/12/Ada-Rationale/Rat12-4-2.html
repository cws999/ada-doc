<H1>4.2 Subprogram parameters</H1>
<div class="Normal">The main topic here is the fact that functions (but 
not operators) in Ada 2012 can have parameters of any mode. <A NAME="I1329"></A><A NAME="I1330"></A><A NAME="I1331"></A></div>
<div class="Normal">This is a topic left over from Ada 2005. The epilogue 
to the Rationale for Ada 2005 <A HREF="Rat12-0-3.html#R15">[15]</A> discusses 
a number of topics that were abandoned and in the case of function modes 
says:</div>
<div class="Normal">&quot;Clearly, Ada functions are indeed curious. 
But strangely this AI (that is <A HREF="http://www.ada-auth.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/AIs/AI-00323.TXT">AI95-323</A>) 
was abandoned quite early in the revision process on the grounds that 
it was 'too late'. (Perhaps too late in this context meant 25 years too 
late.)&quot; It was not possible to agree on a way forward and so effort 
was devoted to other topics.</div>
<div class="Normal">But mists clear with time. The big concern was that 
allowing parameters of all modes might open the door to dangerous programming 
practices but a solution to that was found in the introduction of stricter 
rules preventing many order dependences.</div>
<div class="Normal">It is instructive to quickly go through the various 
historical documents.</div>
<div class="Normal">A probably little known document is one written in 
1976 by David Fisher of the Institute for Defense Analyses <A HREF="Rat12-0-3.html#R16">[16]</A> 
which provided the foundation for the requirements for the development 
of a new language. It doesn't seem to distinguish between procedures 
and functions; it does mention the need for parameters which are constant 
and those which effectively rename a variable. Moreover, it does say 
(item C1 on page 81): <I>Side effects which are dependent on the evaluation 
order among the arguments of an expression will be evaluated left-to-right.</I> 
This does not actually require left-to-right evaluation but the behaviour 
must be as if it were. I have always thought it tragic that this was 
not observed.</div>
<div class="Normal">This document was followed by a series known as Strawman, 
Woodenman, Tinman, Ironman <A HREF="Rat12-0-3.html#R17">[17]</A> and 
finishing with Steelman <A HREF="Rat12-0-3.html#R12">[12]</A>. <A NAME="I1332"></A><A NAME="I1333"></A></div>
<div class="Normal">The requirement on left-to-right evaluation remained 
in Tinman and was even stronger in Ironman but was somewhat weakened 
in Steelman to allow instrumentation and ends with a warning about being 
erroneous.</div>
<div class="Normal">Further requirements are introduced in Ironman which 
requires both functions and procedures as we know them. Moreover, Ironman 
has a requirement about assignment to variables non-local to a function; 
they must be encapsulated in a region that has no calls on the function; 
this same requirement notes that it implies that functions can only have 
input parameters. This requirement does not seem to have carried forward 
to Steelman.</div>
<div class="Normal">However, Ironman also introduces a requirement on 
restrictions to prevent aliasing. One is that the same actual parameter 
of a procedure cannot correspond to more than one input-output parameter. 
This requirement does survive into Steelman. But, it only seems to apply 
to procedures and not to functions and Steelman appears not to have noticed 
that the implied requirement that functions can only have input parameters 
has vanished.</div>
<div class="Normal">It interesting to then see what was proposed in the 
sequence of languages leading to Ada 83, namely, Preliminary Green <A HREF="Rat12-0-3.html#R18">[18]</A>, 
Green <A HREF="Rat12-0-3.html#R19">[19]</A>, Preliminary Ada <A HREF="Rat12-0-3.html#R20">[20]</A>, 
and Ada <A HREF="Rat12-0-3.html#R21">[21]</A>. Note that Preliminary 
Green was based on Ironman whereas Green was based on Steelman.</div>
<div class="Normal" style="margin-bottom: 0.4em">In Preliminary Green<A NAME="I1334"></A> 
we find procedures and functions. Procedures can have parameters of three 
modes, <B>in</B>, <B>out</B> and <B>access</B> (don't get excited, <B>access</B> 
meant <B>in out</B>). Functions can only have parameters of mode <B>in</B>. 
Moreover,</div>
<div class="Indented1">side effects to variables accessible at the function 
call are not allowed. In particular, variables that are global to the 
function body may not be updated in the function body. The rationale 
for Preliminary Green makes it quite clear that functions can have no 
side effects whatsoever.&nbsp;</div>
<div class="Normal" style="margin-bottom: 0.4em">In Green we find the 
three modes <B>in</B>, <B>out</B>, and <B>in out</B>. <A NAME="I1335"></A>But 
the big difference is that as well as procedures and functions as in 
preliminary Green, there are now value returning procedures such as</div>
<div class="SwissExamples"><B>procedure</B>&nbsp;Random&nbsp;<B>return</B>&nbsp;Real&nbsp;<B>range</B>&nbsp;-1.0&nbsp;..&nbsp;1.0;</div>
<div class="Normal" style="margin-bottom: 0.4em">The intent is that 
functions are still free of all side effects whereas value returning 
procedures have more flexibility. However, value returning procedures 
can only have parameters of mode <B>in</B> and</div>
<div class="Indented1">assignments to global variables are permitted 
within value returning procedures. Calls of such procedures are only 
valid at points of the program where the corresponding variables are 
not within the scope of their declaration. The order of evaluation of 
these calls is strictly that given in the text of the program. Calls 
to value returning procedures are only allowed in assignment statements, 
initializations and procedure calls.&nbsp;</div>
<div class="Normal" style="margin-bottom: 0.4em">The rationale for Green 
notes that if you want to instrument a function then use a pragma. It 
also notes that functions</div>
<div class="Indented1">with arbitrary side effects would undermine the 
advantage of the functional approach to software. In addition it would 
complicate the semantics of all language structures where expressions 
involving such calls may occur. Hence this form of function is not provided. 
</div>
<div class="Normal">And now we come to Ada herself. There are manuals 
dated July 1979 (preliminary Ada), July 1980 (draft mil-std), July 1982 
(proposed ANSI standard), and January 1983 (the ANSI standard usually 
known as Ada 83).</div>
<div class="Normal">In Preliminary Ada, we have procedures, functions 
and value returning procedures exactly as in Green. Indeed, it seems 
that the only difference between Green and Preliminary Ada is that the 
name Green has been converted to Ada.<A NAME="I1336"></A></div>
<div class="Normal">But the 1980 Ada manual omits value returning procedures 
and any mention of any restrictions on what you can do in a function. 
And by 1982 we find that we are warned that parameters can be evaluated 
in any order and so on.</div>
<div class="Normal">The Rationale for Ada 83 <A HREF="Rat12-0-3.html#R6">[6]</A> 
didn't finally emerge until 1986 and discusses briefly the reason for 
the change which is basically that benevolent side effects are important. 
It concludes by quoting from a paper regarding Algol 60 <A HREF="Rat12-0-3.html#R22">[22]</A><A NAME="I1337"></A></div>
<div class="Indented1">The plain fact of the matter is (1) that side-effects 
are sometimes necessary, and (2) programmers who are irresponsible enough 
to introduce side-effects unnecessarily will soon lose the confidence 
of their colleagues and rightly so.&nbsp;</div>
<div class="Normal" style="margin-bottom: 0.4em">However, an interesting 
remark in the Rationale for Ada 83 in the light of the change in Ada 
2012 is</div>
<div class="Indented1">The only limitation imposed in Ada on functions 
is that the mode of all parameters must be <B>in</B>: it would not be 
logical to allow <B>in out</B> and <B>out</B> parameters for functions 
in a language that excludes nested assignments within an expression. 
</div>
<div class="Normal">Hmm. That doesn't really seem to follow. Allowing 
assignments in expressions as in C is obnoxious and one of the sources 
of errors in C programs. It is not so much that permitting side-effects 
in expressions via functions is unwise but more that treating the result 
of an assignment as a value nested within an expression is confusing. 
Such nested constructions are naturally still excluded from Ada 2012 
and so it is very unlikely that the change will be regretted. <A NAME="I1338"></A></div>
<div class="Normal" style="margin-bottom: 0.4em">Now we must turn to 
the question of order dependences. Primarily, to enable optimization, 
Ada does not define the order of evaluation of a number of constructions. 
<A NAME="I1339"></A>These include</div>
<div class="Bulleted">the parameters in a subprogram or entry call,</div>
<div class="Bulleted">the operands of a binary operator,</div>
<div class="Bulleted">the destination and value in an assignment,</div>
<div class="Bulleted">the components in an aggregate,</div>
<div class="Bulleted">the index expressions in a multidimensional name,</div>
<div class="Bulleted">the expressions in a range,</div>
<div class="Bulleted">the barriers in a protected object,</div>
<div class="Bulleted">the guards in a select statement,</div>
<div class="Bulleted">the elaboration of library units.&nbsp;</div>
<div class="Normal">The expressions involved in the above constructions 
can include function calls. Indeed, as <A HREF="http://www.ada-auth.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/AI05s/AI05-0144-2.TXT">AI-144</A> 
states &quot;Arguably, Ada has selected the worst possible solution to 
evaluation order dependences (by not specifying an order of evaluation), 
it does not detect them in any way, and then says that if you depend 
upon one (even if by accident), your code will fail at some point in 
the future when your compiler changes. Something should be done about 
this.&quot;</div>
<div class="Normal">It is far too late to do anything about specifying 
the order of evaluation so the approach taken is to prevent as much aliasing 
as possible since aliasing is an important cause of order of evaluation 
problems. Ada 2012 introduces rules for determining when two names are 
&quot;known to denote the same object&quot;. <A NAME="I1340"></A></div>
<div class="Normal" style="margin-bottom: 0.4em">Thus they denote the 
same object if</div>
<div class="Bulleted">both names statically denote the same stand-alone 
object or parameter; or</div>
<div class="Bulleted">both names are selected components, their prefixes 
are known to denote the same object, and their selector names denote 
the same component.&nbsp;</div>
<div class="Normal" style="margin-bottom: 0.4em">and so on with similar 
rules for dereferences, indexed components and slices. There is also 
a rule about renaming so that if we have</div>
<div class="SwissExamples">C:&nbsp;Character&nbsp;<B>renames</B>&nbsp;S(5);</div>
<div class="Normal">then <SPAN Class="swiss">C</SPAN> and <SPAN Class="swiss">S(5)</SPAN> 
are known to denote the same object. The index naturally has to be static.</div>
<div class="Normal">A further step is to define when two names &quot;are 
known to refer to the same object&quot;. This covers some cases of overlapping. 
<A NAME="I1341"></A>Thus given a record <SPAN Class="swiss">R</SPAN> 
of type <SPAN Class="swiss">T</SPAN> with a component <SPAN Class="swiss">C</SPAN>, 
we say that <SPAN Class="swiss">R</SPAN> and <SPAN Class="swiss">R.C</SPAN> 
are known to refer to the same object. Similarly with an array <SPAN Class="swiss">A</SPAN> 
we say that <SPAN Class="swiss">A</SPAN> and <SPAN Class="swiss">A(K)</SPAN> 
are known to refer to the same object (<SPAN Class="swiss">K</SPAN> does 
not need to be static in this example).</div>
<div class="Normal">Given these definitions we can now state the two 
basic restrictions.</div>
<div class="Normal" style="margin-bottom: 0.4em">The first concerns 
parameters of elementary types:</div>
<div class="Bulleted">For each name <SPAN Class="swiss">N</SPAN> that 
is passed as a parameter of mode <B>in out</B> or <B>out</B> to a call 
of a subprogram <SPAN Class="swiss">S</SPAN>, there is no other name 
among the other parameters of mode <B>in out</B> or <B>out</B> to that 
call of <SPAN Class="swiss">S</SPAN> that is known to denote the same 
object.&nbsp;</div>
<div class="Normal">Roughly speaking this comes down to saying two or 
more parameters of mode <B>out</B> or <B>in out</B> of an elementary 
type cannot denote the same object. This applies to both functions and 
procedures.</div>
<div class="Normal" style="margin-bottom: 0.4em">This excludes the example 
given in the Introduction which was</div>
<div class="SwissExamples"><B>procedure</B>&nbsp;Do_It(Double,&nbsp;Triple:&nbsp;<B>in&nbsp;out</B>&nbsp;Integer)&nbsp;<B>is</B></div>
<div class="SwissExamples"><B>begin</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Double&nbsp;:=&nbsp;Double&nbsp;*&nbsp;2;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Triple&nbsp;:=&nbsp;Triple&nbsp;*&nbsp;3;<BR>
<B>end</B>&nbsp;Do_It;</div>
<div class="Normal" style="margin-bottom: 0.4em">with</div>
<div class="SwissExamples">Var:&nbsp;Integer&nbsp;:=&nbsp;2;<BR>
...<BR>
Do_It(Var,&nbsp;Var);&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--&nbsp;<SPAN Class="roman"><I>illegal&nbsp;in&nbsp;Ada&nbsp;2012</I></SPAN></div>
<div class="Normal">The key problem is that parameters of elementary 
types are always passed by copy and the order in which the parameters 
are copied back is not specified. Thus <SPAN Class="swiss">Var</SPAN> 
might end up with either the value of <SPAN Class="swiss">Double</SPAN> 
or the value of <SPAN Class="swiss">Triple</SPAN>.</div>
<div class="Normal" style="margin-bottom: 0.4em">The other restriction 
concerns constructions which have several constituents that can be evaluated 
in any order and can contain function calls. Basically it says:</div>
<div class="Bulleted">If a name <SPAN Class="swiss">N</SPAN> is passed 
as a parameter with mode <B>out</B> or <B>in out</B> to a function call 
that occurs in one of the constituents, then no other constituent can 
involve a name that is known to refer to the same object.&nbsp;</div>
<div class="Normal">Constructions cover many situations such as aggregates, 
assignments, ranges and so on as listed earlier.</div>
<div class="Normal" style="margin-bottom: 0.4em">This rule excludes 
the other example in the Introduction, namely, the aggregate</div>
<div class="SwissExamples">(Var,&nbsp;F(Var))&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--&nbsp;<SPAN Class="roman"><I>illegal&nbsp;in&nbsp;Ada&nbsp;2012</I></SPAN></div>
<div class="Normal">where <SPAN Class="swiss">F</SPAN> has an <B>in out</B> 
parameter.</div>
<div class="Normal" style="margin-bottom: 0.4em">The rule also excludes 
the assignment</div>
<div class="SwissExamples">Var&nbsp;:=&nbsp;F(Var);&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--&nbsp;<SPAN Class="roman"><I>illegal</I></SPAN></div>
<div class="Normal">if the parameter of <SPAN Class="swiss">F</SPAN> 
has mode <B>in out</B>. Remember that the destination of an assignment 
can be evaluated before or after the expression. So if <SPAN Class="swiss">Var</SPAN> 
were an array element such as <SPAN Class="swiss">A(I)</SPAN> then the 
behaviour could vary according to the order. To encourage good practice, 
it is also forbidden even when <SPAN Class="swiss">Var</SPAN> is a stand-alone 
object.</div>
<div class="Normal" style="margin-bottom: 0.4em">Similarly, the procedure 
call</div>
<div class="SwissExamples">Proc(Var,&nbsp;F(Var));&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--&nbsp;<SPAN Class="roman"><I>illegal</I></SPAN></div>
<div class="Normal" style="margin-bottom: 0.4em">is illegal if the parameter 
of <SPAN Class="swiss">F</SPAN> has mode <B>in out</B>. Examples of overlapping 
are also forbidden such as</div>
<div class="SwissExamples">ProcA(A,&nbsp;F(A(K)));&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--&nbsp;<SPAN Class="roman"><I>illegal</I></SPAN></div>
<div class="SwissExamples">ProcR(R,&nbsp;F(R.C));&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--&nbsp;<SPAN Class="roman"><I>illegal</I></SPAN></div>
<div class="Normal">assuming still that <SPAN Class="swiss">F</SPAN> 
has an <B>in out</B> parameter and that <SPAN Class="swiss">ProcA</SPAN> 
and <SPAN Class="swiss">ProcR</SPAN> have appropriate profiles because, 
as explained above, <SPAN Class="swiss">A</SPAN> and <SPAN Class="swiss">A(K)</SPAN> 
are known to refer to the same object as are <SPAN Class="swiss">R</SPAN> 
and <SPAN Class="swiss">R.C</SPAN>.</div>
<div class="Normal" style="margin-bottom: 0.4em">On the other hand</div>
<div class="SwissExamples">Proc(A(J),&nbsp;F(A(K)));&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--&nbsp;<SPAN Class="roman"><I>OK</I></SPAN></div>
<div class="Normal">is permitted provided that <SPAN Class="swiss">J</SPAN> 
and <SPAN Class="swiss">K</SPAN> are different objects because this is 
only a problem if <SPAN Class="swiss">J</SPAN> and <SPAN Class="swiss">K</SPAN> 
happen to have the same value.</div>
<div class="Normal">For more details the reader is referred to the AI. 
The intent is to detect situations that are clearly troublesome. Other 
situations that might be troublesome (such as if <SPAN Class="swiss">J</SPAN> 
and <SPAN Class="swiss">K</SPAN> happen to have the same value) are allowed, 
since to prevent them would make many programs illegal that are not actually 
dubious. This would cause incompatibilities and upset many users whose 
programs are perfectly correct.</div>
<div class="Normal" style="margin-bottom: 0.4em">The other change in 
Ada 2012 concerning parameters is that they may be explicitly marked 
<B>aliased</B> thus<A NAME="I1342"></A><A NAME="I1343"></A> <A NAME="I1344"></A></div>
<div class="SwissExamples"><B>procedure</B>&nbsp;P(X:&nbsp;<B>aliased&nbsp;in&nbsp;out</B>&nbsp;T;&nbsp;...&nbsp;);</div>
<div class="Normal">As a consequence within <SPAN Class="swiss">P</SPAN> 
we can write <SPAN Class="swiss">X'Access</SPAN>. Recall that tagged 
types were always considered implicitly aliased anyway and always passed 
by reference. If the type <SPAN Class="swiss">T</SPAN> is a by-copy type 
such as <SPAN Class="swiss">Integer</SPAN>, then adding <B>aliased</B> 
causes it to be passed by reference. (So by-copy types are not always 
passed by copy!)</div>
<div class="Normal" style="margin-bottom: 0.4em">The possibility of 
permitting explicitly aliased function results such as</div>
<div class="SwissExamples"><B>function</B>&nbsp;F(&nbsp;...&nbsp;)<B>return&nbsp;aliased</B>&nbsp;T;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--<SPAN Class="roman"><I>illegal&nbsp;Ada&nbsp;2012</I></SPAN></div>
<div class="Normal">was considered but this led to difficulties and so 
was not pursued.</div>
<div class="Normal" style="margin-bottom: 0.4em">The syntax for parameter 
specification is modified thus</div>
<div class="SwissExamples">parameter_specification&nbsp;::=<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;defining_identifier_list:&nbsp;[<B>aliased</B>]&nbsp;mode&nbsp;[null&nbsp;exclusion]&nbsp;subtype_mark&nbsp;[:=&nbsp;default_expression]<BR>
&nbsp;|&nbsp;defining_identifier_list:&nbsp;access_definition&nbsp;[:=&nbsp;default_expression]</div>
<div class="Normal">showing that <B>aliased</B> comes first as it does 
in all contexts where it is permitted.</div>
<div class="Normal">The rules for mode conformance are modified as expected. 
Two profiles are only mode conformant if both or neither are explicitly 
marked as aliased. Although adding <B>aliased</B> for a tagged type parameter 
makes little difference since tagged types are implicitly aliased, if 
this is done for a subprogram declaration then it must be done for the 
corresponding body as well.</div>
<div class="Normal">There are (of course) rules regarding accessibility; 
these are much as expected although a special case arises in function 
return statements. These allow a function to safely return an access 
to a part of an explicitly aliased parameter and be assured that the 
result will not outlive the parameter. As usual, if the foolish programmer 
does something silly, the compiler will draw attention to the error.</div>
<div class="Normal">Explicitly aliased parameters are used in the functions 
Reference (and Constant_Reference) declared in the various container 
packages. See Section <A HREF="Rat12-6-3.html">6.3</A> on Iteration and 
Section <A HREF="Rat12-8-3.html">8.3</A> on Iterating and updating containers.</div>
