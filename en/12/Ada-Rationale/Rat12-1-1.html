<H1>1.1 Revision process</H1>
<div class="Normal">Ada has evolved over a number of years and, especially 
for those unfamiliar with the background, it is convenient to summarize 
the processes involved. The first version was Ada 83 and this was developed 
by a team led by the late Jean Ichbiah and funded by the USDoD. The development 
of Ada 95 from Ada 83 was an extensive process also funded by the USDoD. 
Formal requirements were established after comprehensive surveys of user 
needs and competitive proposals were then submitted resulting in the 
selection of Intermetrics as the developer under the leadership of Tucker 
Taft. Then came Ada 2005 and this was developed on a more modest scale. 
The work was almost entirely done by voluntary effort with support from 
within the industry itself through bodies such as the Ada Resource Association 
and Ada-Europe. <A NAME="I1011"></A><A NAME="I1012"></A><A NAME="I1013"></A><A NAME="I1014"></A></div>
<div class="Normal">After some experience with Ada 2005 it became clear 
that some further evolution was appropriate. Adding new features as in 
Ada 2005 always brings some surprises regarding their use and further 
polishing is almost inevitable. Accordingly, it was decided that a further 
revision should be made with a goal of completion in 2012.</div>
<div class="Normal">As in the case of Ada 2005, the development is being 
performed under the guidance of ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22 WG9 (hereinafter just 
called WG9). Previously chaired by Jim Moore, it is now under the chairmanship 
of Joyce Tokar. This committee has included national representatives 
of many nations including Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, 
Sweden, Switzerland, the UK and the USA. WG9 developed guidelines <A HREF="Rat12-0-3.html#R1">[1]</A> 
for a revision to Ada 2005 which were then used by the Ada Rapporteur 
Group (the ARG) in drafting the revised standard. <A NAME="I1015"></A><A NAME="I1016"></A></div>
<div class="Normal">The ARG is a team of experts nominated by the national 
bodies represented on WG9 and the two liaison organizations, ACM SIGAda 
and Ada-Europe. In the case of Ada 2005, the ARG was originally led by 
Erhard Pl&ouml;dereder and then by Pascal Leroy. For Ada 2012, it is 
led by Ed Schonberg. The editor, who at the end of the day actually writes 
the words of the standard, continues to be the indefatigable Randy Brukardt. 
<A NAME="I1017"></A><A NAME="I1018"></A><A NAME="I1019"></A><A NAME="I1020"></A></div>
<div class="Normal">Suggestions for the revised standard have come from 
a number of sources such as individuals on the ARG, national bodies on 
WG9, users and implementers via email discussions on Ada-Comment and 
so on. Also several issues were left over from the development of Ada 
2005.</div>
<div class="Normal">At the time of writing (August 2011), the revision 
process is approaching completion. The details of all individual changes 
are now clear and they are being integrated to form a new version of 
the Annotated Ada Reference Manual. The final approved standard should 
emerge towards the end of 2012.</div>
